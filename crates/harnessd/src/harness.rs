//! **The loop.** Submit → stream → parse a tool call → execute it → append the

//!        ▲                                                       │

//!   ToolResult item <──transcript_item── ToolRuntime::invoke ── yes
//! ```
//!
//! `ToolRuntime::transcript_item` and `ToolLogSink` were the two ends of this wire
//! and both were tested. This file is what runs between them.
//!
//! # Three things this file had to decide that no crate had decided
//!
//! **1. Item ids are minted by two different rules, and the head needs both.**
//! `Session::append_items` mints `"{transcript}.{index}"`; the turn engine mints
//! `"{turn_id}.{n}"`. §4.5's `TranscriptAppended` carries no content, so the daemon
//! has to call `Hub::record_item(item_id, item)` out of band — and it must use the
//! *same* id the event carried, or the head shows an empty row forever. Rather than
//! reimplementing both rules and going stale, [`CapturingSink`] reads the id off
//! the event on its way past. That is not a workaround for T13.1; T13.1 is the
//! event having no content channel, and widening it unilaterally is not this
//! strand's call.
//!
//! **2. A failed turn leaves nothing to answer.** When §5.7 refuses a batch, the
//! engine commits *nothing* — so there are no tool-call rows to attach pi's
//! "re-issue with complete arguments" notice to. The notice therefore goes in as a
//! plain user item, which is the only append-only place it fits, and the loop
//! retries under the engine's own salvage budget rather than a second counter.
//!
//! **3. A tool batch is executed in call order and appended in call order.** Not a
//! style choice: GLM's shipped template *sorts* tool results by tool-call order, so
//! appending them in any other order would rewrite bytes already in the KV cache.
//! Keeping call order makes the template's sort a no-op and both properties hold at
//! once.
